# CSS Styling Project

## Description
This project contains custom CSS styles for creating visually appealing web designs. It includes techniques for styling images (e.g., filters, hover effects, responsive layouts) and blending background colors using gradients and animations. The goal is to provide reusable CSS snippets for modern web development.

## Features
- **Image Styling**: Hover effects, filters (grayscale, blur), `object-fit` for responsive images, and `clip-path` for unique shapes.
- **Background Blends**: Linear and radial gradients, animated background color transitions, and blend modes with images.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries for mobile-friendly layouts.
- **Accessibility**: Focus styles and descriptive alt text for images.
